## This project is no more maitained as I have forked Fest Assert to create [AssertJ core](https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core), [AssertJ examples](https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-examples), [AssertJ joda time](https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-joda-time), [AssertJ guava](https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-guava), [AssertJ assertions generator](https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-assertions-generator)
